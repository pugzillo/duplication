Repo includes scripts that are used in find lineage specific gene duplicates in a group of species

Scripts:
1. genefamily_pipeline_threaded.pl: for all fasta files in the directory, it does blastall and single linkage clustering with MCL
2. parse_MCL_outfile.pl: parses the MCL clustering output into a nice output file.
